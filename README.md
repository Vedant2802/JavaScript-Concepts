# JavaScript Concepts

This repository contains various JavaScript concepts, examples, and projects organized in a structured manner for learning and reference.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 01. Core Concepts (`01-core-concepts/`)

Fundamental JavaScript concepts and building blocks:

- **Arrays** - Array manipulation and methods
- **Objects** - Object-oriented concepts and object manipulation
- **Functions** - Functions, closures, and lexical scoping
- **Classes** - Classes and OOP concepts
- **Events** - Event handling and DOM events
- **Async** - Asynchronous programming, promises, and async/await

### 02. Advanced Topics (`02-advanced-topics/`)

More complex JavaScript features and techniques:

- **DOM** - Advanced DOM manipulation and techniques
- **Polyfills** - Custom implementations and polyfills
- **Animations** - Animation examples and techniques

### 03. Data Structures & Performance (`03-data-structures/`)

Data structures and performance optimization:

- **Basic Structures** - Fundamental data structures (Maps, Sets, etc.)
- **Performance** - Performance optimization techniques and benchmarks

### 04. Projects (`04-projects/`)

Complete applications and practical implementations:

- **Basic Projects** - Simple projects (Stopwatch, Quiz Game)
- **Intermediate Projects** - Medium complexity (API requests, Async projects)
- **Advanced Projects** - Complex applications (Library Management System)

### 05. Examples (`05-examples/`)

Standalone examples and code snippets:

- **Basics** - Execution context, hoisting, lexical scope, shadowing
- **Functions** - Function concepts, closures, higher-order functions, callbacks
- **Objects** - Object concepts, prototypes, inheritance
- **Async** - Asynchronous programming examples
- **Advanced** - Advanced techniques and patterns

### 06. Revision (`06-revision/`)

Quick reference materials and review content:

- Async/await examples
- Fetch API examples
- Promise examples
- General revision materials

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Choose your learning path**: Start with core concepts if you're new to JavaScript
2. **Explore examples**: Each concept has practical examples in the `05-examples/` directory
3. **Build projects**: Apply your knowledge by working through the projects
4. **Review**: Use the revision materials for quick reference

## üìö Learning Path

### Beginner

1. Start with `01-core-concepts/` - Arrays, Objects, Functions
2. Practice with `05-examples/01-basics/` and `05-examples/02-functions/`
3. Build simple projects in `04-projects/01-basic-projects/`

### Intermediate

1. Explore `01-core-concepts/` - Classes, Events, Async
2. Study `02-advanced-topics/` - DOM, Polyfills
3. Work on `04-projects/02-intermediate-projects/`

### Advanced

1. Master `02-advanced-topics/` - Advanced DOM, Animations
2. Study `03-data-structures/` - Performance optimization
3. Build complex projects in `04-projects/03-advanced-projects/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

Feel free to add more examples or improve existing ones. Please maintain the folder structure when adding new content:

- Use numbered prefixes for main directories (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Create subdirectories for better categorization
- Add descriptive README files in each directory
- Keep examples focused and well-commented

## üìù Notes

- Each directory contains its own examples and implementations
- Navigate to the specific concept you want to explore
- Examples are designed to be run independently
- Projects include complete applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
